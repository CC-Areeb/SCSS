Headings:

We have basic h1 to h6 headings in the web but
now with SASS/SCSS, there are display headings,
these are similar to bootstrap display headings
with name but different in font sizes
(more display headings can be added if needed)

examples of display headings from 1 to 5:
        <p class="display-1">Display 1</p> <br>
        <p class="display-2">Display 2</p> <br>
        <p class="display-3">Display 3</p> <br>
        <p class="display-4">Display 4</p> <br>
        <p class="display-5">Display 5</p> <br>





Font size:
Added 4 basic font sizes

1) Extra small   example ------> <span class="font-sm-2">Small</span> 
2) Small         example ------> <span class="font-sm-2">Extra small</span> 
3) Large         example ------> <span class="font-lg-1">Large</span> 
4) Extra large   example ------> <span class="font-lg-2">Extra large</span> 



Card:
under progress ...
this includes things like box shadows and possibly
different margin and paddings



Color palet:
Added few basic colors with some basic shades 
example of text color ----> <span class="text-cyan">text is cyan</span>

this includes text colors and background colors
example of background color -----> <span class="bg-cyan text-white">bg is cyan</span>



Hover:
A small hover unitiliy class where if you hover
a link, it will change its color let's say from
light red to light blue

example:    <a href="#" class="text-blue-light-6 text-hover-red-light-7">Hover over me!</a>




Buttons:
3 types of buttons:
(Note that when using anchor, the size is a bit bigger than the button tag)

1---> Generic with a default color
example: <a href="#" class="btn">default button</a>



2---> Basic button with colors and change of shade when hovered
example: <a href="#" class="btn-cyan text-white">click me!</a>



3---> Outlined button with colors and change of shade when hovered
example: <a href="#" class="btn-outlined-cyan">click me!</a>



button tags vs anchor tags
 button tag size is a bit small than the anchor tag size
 try to use both and see what fits your needs ðŸ˜‡

 example of a anchor tag: <a href="#" class="btn-error text-white">click me!</a>

 example of a button tag: <button class="btn-outlined-teal">I am a button, click me!</button>





NOTE:
error and notify are just a varient of basic red and green colors respectivly
these are so that you can use error to alert users that something is incorrect
and the notify means that the users can get a notification of something



Media Querries:
The use of media queries is so that we can apply styles differently whenever
the breakpoint changes 

the bwlow is a small test to see if colors change at different breakpoints:
<p class="responsive-test font-lg-2">
        This is a test to see color changing at different break points
</p>

note: the test class is called responsive-test and this is how it looks

.responsive-test
{
    @include xs -----------------> extra small
    {
        color: red;
    }

    @include sm -----------------> small
    {
        color: orange;
    }

    @include md -----------------> meduim
    {
        color: purple;
    }

    @include lg -----------------> large
    {
        color: blue;
    }

    @include xl -----------------> extra large
    {
        color: darkcyan;
    }
}

CONTAINER:
The container is used as a means to centeralize the contents in the center
in your code you will use it like this:
<div class="container">
    // your html
</div>



GRID SYSTEM:
With the grid system, we can now make responsive designs for different screen
widths or breakpoints by adding class like ("col-1-xs") after your containers
this is done for all the breakpoints. You need to be careful when you use this 
as all the column must be inside the row classes as the .row class has the flex
display class used to set all the columns

this is how to use with a card inside it and you can use more than 1 breakpoints
in just 1 container:

<div class="col-12-xs col-5-sm col-3-xl">
    <div class="card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Hey fellow devs!</h3>
        <p class="card-body">
            This is an example of a grid system, cool isn't it!! ðŸ˜ƒ
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

GAPS:
We have made a small gap system so that elements can have a gap between them

this us how to use them:
<div class="row gap-2">
    // your html
</div>



FLEX:
We have made a flex item system where devs can use the classes and have thier
content justify at where they want

useage:
<div class="justify-center">
    // your html
</div>

other classes include:
flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around

just replace center with these and it will apply the property
