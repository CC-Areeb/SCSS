Headings:

We have basic h1 to h6 headings in the web but
now with SASS/SCSS, there are display headings,
these are similar to bootstrap display headings
with name but different in font sizes
(more display headings can be added if needed)

examples of display headings from 1 to 5:
        <p class="display-1">Display 1</p> <br>
        <p class="display-2">Display 2</p> <br>
        <p class="display-3">Display 3</p> <br>
        <p class="display-4">Display 4</p> <br>
        <p class="display-5">Display 5</p> <br>





Font size:
Added 4 basic font sizes

1) Extra small   example ------> <span class="font-sm-2">Small</span> 
2) Small         example ------> <span class="font-sm-2">Extra small</span> 
3) Large         example ------> <span class="font-lg-1">Large</span> 
4) Extra large   example ------> <span class="font-lg-2">Extra large</span> 



Card:

different margin and paddings



Color palet:
Added few basic colors with some basic shades 
example of text color ----> <span class="text-cyan">text is cyan</span>

this includes text colors and background colors
example of background color -----> <span class="bg-cyan text-white">bg is cyan</span>



Hover:
A small hover unitiliy class where if you hover
a link, it will change its color let's say from
light red to light blue

example:    <a href="#" class="text-blue-light-6 text-hover-red-light-7">Hover over me!</a>




Buttons:
3 types of buttons:
(Note that when using anchor, the size is a bit bigger than the button tag)

1---> Generic with a default color
example: <a href="#" class="btn">default button</a>



2---> Basic button with colors and change of shade when hovered
example: <a href="#" class="btn-cyan text-white">click me!</a>



3---> Outlined button with colors and change of shade when hovered
example: <a href="#" class="btn-outlined-cyan">click me!</a>



button tags vs anchor tags
 button tag size is a bit small than the anchor tag size
 try to use both and see what fits your needs ðŸ˜‡

 example of a anchor tag: <a href="#" class="btn-error text-white">click me!</a>

 example of a button tag: <button class="btn-outlined-teal">I am a button, click me!</button>





NOTE:
error and notify are just a varient of basic red and green colors respectivly
these are so that you can use error to alert users that something is incorrect
and the notify means that the users can get a notification of something
