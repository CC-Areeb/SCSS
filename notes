gulp is the task runner which is going to run our compilation tasks
gulp-sass is the plug-in for gulp to compile our sass
sass package is used by the plug-in 
--save-dev flag means that these packages will be stored in the json file as dev dependancies 
a gulp js file for gulp to run and for compiling sass to css

name has to be like gulpfile.js cuz it works like this .... ðŸ˜…



src, dest, watch, series are the packages we will import for gulp


                            ************************* BIG NOTE *************************

always define your sass coding first and then define your normal css when you want to use the sass components 



Use partials for different sass coding as saving all in 1 file will make is too hard to read and messy
example: @import 'variables'; 
this is how we can import other sass files into our main sass file



using underscore (_) before naming the scss file will make sure that the it will not
compile in a css file as we are only using variables.scss to keep our code 
clean and readable.

This is how we define partials in a nutshell
